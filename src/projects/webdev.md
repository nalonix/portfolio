Below are some web apps build with various tech stacks.

### **Grade Report**

<span class="tag">SvelteKit</span> <span class="tag">MongoDb</span> <span class="tag">TS</span>

A project I built for my college to help the deliver student grades with ease. It was build to address the issues of record security and minimal friction for adoption by the school. It achieves this by being separate from the database the keeps the actual data, and serving ONlY as a report delivery system.

### **Spotlight**

<span class="tag">Next.js</span> <span class="tag">SHADCN</span> <span class="tag">Clerk</span>

Inspired by a struggle my digital marketer friend had with buidilng a portfolio, I build a SaaS that allows non-technical users to create a portfolio and showcase their work to a wider audience. This was my first shot at building a SaaS. It had a some services that were meant to free up storage space and allow for more efficient use of storage space. Has chapa integrated with a one time payment system.

### **Etubers**

<span class="tag">Next.js</span> <span class="tag">SHADCN</span> <span class="tag">MongoDb</span>

A learning management system for one of the notable content creators in Ethiopia.

### **HuleChereta**

<span class="tag">Next.js</span> <span class="tag">Lucia</span>

An Ethiopian auction platform with multilanguage support. Speifically tailored for the real estate market in Ethiopia. This was the first time I had a change to deploy on a barebones VPS.
Might be out of norm as a developer, but since the clients were a traditional company they request user registrations to be unto an excel file. I had to build a custom registration form to handle this.
Organizing the large volume of downloadable files and presenting the readable information without degrading aesthetics were the monst interesting challenges.
The site is currently down, as they have discontinued the service. Here's a version I have uploaded on vercel for reference.
