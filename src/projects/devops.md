## DevOps üêã

<hr />

### **Web Server Configuration**

<span class="tag">Docker</span> <span class="tag">NGNIX</span>

I configured and managed server infrastructure, including authentication, security, port hardening, and performance optimization. Set up Cloudflare DNS with CAPTCHA for enhanced security, configured email forwarding, and deployed web servers with reverse proxies. Dockerized applications for scalability and used process management tools for efficiency. Implemented monitoring with Checkmk for real-time insights. Established CI/CD pipelines to deploy development and main branches separately, automating subdomain creation for new branches and updating production on merges to main. This experience, reinforced by a networking course, streamlined my approach to server management and deployment workflows.

My skill is still highlevel but I have a good grasp of the concepts and tools involed.
